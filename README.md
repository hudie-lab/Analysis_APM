# Analysis_APM

APM model is aimed to partition the genetic variance components of human complex traits due to additive, parent-of origin and maternal genetic effects based on mother-child genotypes.

The R scripts are used to:
+ run a set of simulations of APM model with or without the fixed effects 
+ compare REML, PCGC and R-PCGC in the estimation with case-control studies
+ hold the functions to be used in simulating data which are cited from [1](#Golan2014), [2](#Yang2011), and [3](#Laurin2018)
